Project Two - Q-learning pirate treasure maze.

- For this project, we were given a framework of Python code for implementing our own Q-Learning algorithm. The goal of the agent was to navigate a maze and find the treasure at the end of it. Within the framework existed helpful functions for doing things such as rewarding the AI agent.

- As computer scientists, we design, develop, and analyze software and hardware used across multiple industries and applications. Especially in the modern day with technology and computers everywhere, this is a very impactful field that touches everyone's lives. Ethically speaking, responsibilities to the end users and organization for which a product is being developed might include transparency, data privacy, using secure practices to protect sensitive data, and avoiding potential harmful biases that an AI agent or algorithm may exhibit.
